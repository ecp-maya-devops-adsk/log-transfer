    ========== AL USD Plugin ==========
    CMake Deprecation Warning at plugin/al/CMakeLists.txt:7 (cmake_policy):
      The OLD behavior for policy CMP0026 will be removed from a future version
      of CMake.
    
      The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
      policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
      specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
      behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

    CMake Deprecation Warning at plugin/al/CMakeLists.txt:7 (cmake_policy):
      The OLD behavior for policy CMP0026 will be removed from a future version
      of CMake.
    
      The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
      policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
      specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
      behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
